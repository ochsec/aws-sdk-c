# AWS SDK C - Implementation Strategy

## Overview
The goal is to transform the AWS SDK C project into a cross-platform, portable library using Cosmopolitan libc (cosmocc), enabling "build once, run anywhere" functionality across multiple operating systems.

## Key Strategies

### 1. Dependency Management
- Incorporate AWS SDK dependencies directly into the project
- Create a unified source code repository
- Remove external dependency management complexities

### 2. Cross-Platform Compilation
- Utilize Cosmopolitan libc (cosmocc) for portable compilation
- Generate a single binary that runs natively on:
  * Linux
  * macOS
  * Windows
  * FreeBSD
  * OpenBSD
  * NetBSD

### 3. Build Process
- Develop a streamlined build system
- Minimize platform-specific conditional compilation
- Ensure consistent performance across target platforms

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive cross-platform test suites
- Validate functionality on multiple operating systems
- Benchmark performance against original implementation

## Expected Outcomes
- Simplified dependency management
- Reduced complexity in cross-platform development
- Improved portability of the AWS SDK C library
- Enhanced developer experience with a unified build process

## Next Steps
1. Extract and vendor dependencies
2. Develop Cosmopolitan compatibility layer
3. Implement cross-platform build scripts
4. Create comprehensive test infrastructure
