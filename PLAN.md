**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Step 1: Resolve Build Failures (Primary)**
    *   **Goal:** Achieve a successful compilation of the entire project.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Analyze the specific compiler error message related to `src/io/tee_input_stream.c` (and any subsequent errors).
        *   Based on the error, modify the code in `src/io/tee_input_stream.c` or potentially related header files (`include/aws/io/tee_input_stream.h`, `include/aws/common/byte_buf.h`, etc.) to fix the issue. *Self-correction: Based on the previous checkpoint notes and common C errors, this might involve correcting function arguments (e.g., ensuring `aws_byte_buf_append` receives a cursor instead of a buffer) or resolving include conflicts.*
        *   Iteratively attempt to build and fix errors until the build succeeds.

2.  **Step 2: Run Unit Tests**
    *   **Goal:** Verify the correctness of the SigV4 logic and tee stream implementation after the build fixes.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Locate the test executable (likely `aws-sdk-c-tests` in the build directory).
        *   Execute the tests.
        *   If any tests fail, analyze the failure output and debug the relevant code (`tests/sigv4_test.c`, `src/auth/sigv4.c`, `src/io/tee_input_stream.c`). Fix the underlying issues and re-run tests until all pass.

3.  **Step 3: Manual Integration Testing (External)**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the SigV4 implementation works correctly against actual AWS services.
    *   **Action (Requires Manual Execution):**
        *   Define test cases (e.g., signing requests for S3 GET/PUT, potentially other services).
        *   Configure AWS credentials securely.
        *   Use the SDK (potentially via the example application `examples/s3_list_buckets.c` or a new test program) to send signed requests to AWS.
        *   Verify successful responses and check CloudTrail logs if necessary.
        *   Test with edge cases: empty body, large body (if feasible), special characters in URI/headers.
    *   *Note: This step cannot be performed automatically by me and requires manual effort.*

4.  **Step 4: Performance Optimization (Conditional)**
    *   **Goal:** Address potential memory issues with the tee stream for very large request bodies, *if* identified as a problem during integration testing or based on requirements.
    *   **Action:**
        *   If the current buffering approach is problematic:
            *   Analyze the feasibility of alternative tee stream implementations (e.g., using temporary files, chunked buffering).
            *   Implement and test the chosen optimization.
        *   If performance is acceptable, no action is needed for this step.

5.  **Step 5: Documentation (Usage Examples)**
    *   **Goal:** Provide clear examples for developers on how to use the `aws_sigv4_sign_request` function.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Write a concise code example demonstrating the signing of a typical HTTP request (e.g., an S3 GET request).
        *   Include necessary setup (allocator, credentials, request structure).
        *   Add this example to a suitable location, such as:
            *   A new markdown file (e.g., `docs/sigv4_usage_example.md`).
            *   Appending to the existing `README.md` or `technical.md`.
            *   As comments within the main header `include/aws/auth/sigv4.h`.
